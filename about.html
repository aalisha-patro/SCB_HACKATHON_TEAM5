                <p>Between 2015 and 2019 Sam attend the University of Greenwich, graduating with a 1st Class degree in BA Hons Public Relations & Communications. Once moving out and to another city in 2019, the pandemic hit, the world was in lockdown, and social interactions were almost completely limited to the screen.</p> 
                <p>Such developments encouraged Sam to create Coca Women Wellness, an online platform designed to provide online communities with resources focused on promoting mindfulness practices and wellbeing.</p>
                <p>In line with her passion for African & Caribbean culture(s), health, and wellbeing, she decided to create the online platform - Coca Women Wellness. Her key aspiration and hopes for this site is to increase awareness around a variety of content that positively influences African & Caribbean culture, and the wellbeing of those within it.</p>
                <p>Sam is currently working on several projects shedding more light, and developing the presence of, African Caribbean culture in media, health and other social spheres.</p>

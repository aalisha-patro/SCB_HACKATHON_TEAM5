## 1. Overview

The Coca Women Wellness (CWW) website provides primary and secondary content that helps users develop mindfulness practices that can bolster their wellbeing. 

CWW aspires to assist in supporting initiatives around the wellbeing of minority ethnic communities, particularly African & Caribbean communities. To contribute to diversity and inclusion initiatives in the creative industry, CWW also shares content that has been curated by mindfulness and wellbeing influencers from the African & Caribbean diaspora. 

A secondary goal for CWW is to foster an online wellbeing community for users through sharing digital resources; as well as hosting in-person/online and social meetups (e.g. in-person and zoom).

## 2. User Experience (UX)

### 2.1 User Stories (Strategy)

#### **2.1.1 Market Research**

Market research was conducted during the early stages of building the CWW website. Primary focus was placed on societal factors that commonly impact people's wellbeing. The research unearthed several findings around the topic of wellbeing, which contributed to the conceptualisation of the Coca Women Wellness website. Some of the findings are listed below:  

- Due to ongoing socio-cultural and social-economic inequality in multiple societies (e.g. COVID-19 and continued social inequality); there has been an increased demand to raise awareness around, and provide greater support for improving people’s wellbeing. 

- Further, there has been an increased volume of socio-economic initiatives that aim to bolster the mental, social, and emotional wellbeing of minority groups, including those within the African & Caribbean diaspora. 

- The findings produced from many reports into BAME wellbeing has suggested that UK BAME women, particularly those of African & Caribbean heritage, are at a greater risk of experiencing socio-economic inequalities. In turn, such inequalities can increase the risk of many women from these groups developing health issues such as anxiety, stress and even depression (Forward UK, 2021). 

Considering this, a primary service that CWW provides is hosting and sharing primary and secondary wellbeing media and resources (e.g. images, videos, tutorials, influencers, and recipes) tailored to the interests of women within African & Caribbean communities. 

#### **2.1.2 Essential Definitions – ‘Mindfulness’ and ‘Wellbeing’**

Understanding the semantic meaning and differences between the terms ‘Mindfulness’ and ‘Wellbeing’ was an essential step in the development of the Coca Women Wellness website. These concepts are defined below: 

**Wellbeing**

Wellbeing is considered a _‘… broad concept…relating to…personal dignity (including treatment of the individual with respect)…, physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing,.. social and economic wellbeing. To summarise, ‘…Wellbeing encompasses several areas of life.'.  As such, it is a growing consensus that _‘…using a holistic approach to ensure a clear understanding of the individual’s views is vital to identifying and defining wellbeing in each case.”_ (Hpft.nhs.uk., 2021).

**Mindfulness**

Mindfulness is characterised as _“…the practice of maintaining a non-judgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.”_  (Merriam-Webster.com, 2021).

With these definitions in mind, rather than being interchangeable, wellbeing and mindfulness can be regarded as adjoining concepts. Arguably, developing mindful practices (in whatever area(s)of life) is likely to positively impact overall wellbeing.

#### **2.1.3 Key Demographic(s)**

‘Demographics’ relates to the characteristics of a population and the specific groups within it. As such, the key demographical factors of CWW’s target audience are: 

- Sex: Women 
- Age: 16-40
- Ethnicity: African & Caribbean heritage 

#### **2.1.4 Psychographics**

‘Psychographics’ refers to the common socio-psychological factors (e.g. motivations, priorities, perspectives etc.) that influences a person’s or groups’, beliefs, expectations, perspectives and hence behaviours.

Prior to creating the website, some market research was conducted to gain insight into the potential psychographic expectations of the target audience. The research specifically focused on their expectations when visiting sites that offer resources around mindfulness and/or wellbeing. As such, several women were asked the following questions:

1.	Do you visit any wellbeing sites/apps? If so could provide some names?

2.	Do you follow any black female wellbeing influencers?

3.	Do you think wellbeing content created by, and for, black women would help support your wellbeing?

4.	If you were looking at a wellbeing sites designed to promote the wellbeing of black women - what type of content would you like to see? 

5.	How do you prefer wellbeing topics/content to be presented to you (e.g. via blogs, videos, images, courses, or books)?

The participants’ responses are documented in the table below: 

|Q/User| User ‘R’| User ‘A’| User ‘L’| User ‘AM’| 
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------
|Q1.|- “…Influencers: **kokobo fitness** - recommended by my sister but I don't know such black influencers myself.”| N/A| “…Emmm I normally go on **skin care** websites. Cleansers/lotions designed for the **black skin**…”|“No I haven’t visited any well-being apps recently.”|
|Q2.|“…Not ones specifically for black woman per se but I use the **Headspace app**.”|N/A|N/A|“Not specifically for well-being no.”|
|Q3.|“…Yeah, BW content could support my wellbeing but I haven't really looked for it.” |“…I think it would be the importance of vulnerability, and black women have it in is too.  I think **self concept** is vital too.” |N/A|“Yes it would be **encouraging** to see **other black women** who are passionate about looking after **their well-being**…”|
|Q4.|N/A|N/A|“… The content I would like to say is **skin care**, brightening creams/lotions. **Products** that make **chocolate skin glow**....**Healthy** vegetarian **meals**… Also more thing Samara, **hair** products for relaxed hair.”| “I would like to see content relating to **emotional, physical and spiritual well-being**, basically **all aspects of life**”|
|Q5.|N/A|“Blogs and videos.”|N/A|“…books (audio books); videos; vlogs; blogs”|

In extension to the research, the methods outlined in the ‘5 Planes of UX Design Model’ (5PUXD) was referred to. In particular, the [‘strategy plane’](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.) principle assisted in identifying the key deliverables of the site. These deliverables were determined and valued by perceived importance, viability, and feasibility. This approach produced the following data: 

| Opportunities | IMPORTANCE| VIABILITY/FEASIBILITY| 
|-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| (U/SO) a. Host and share resources that helps users learn mindful, wellbeing and self-improvement techniques. |5 | 5 |

#### **2.1.5 User stories – A Summary** 

Based on the interpretations derived from the data; the core goals of first-time visitors, reoccurring visitors and the site owner are: 

#### **First-time visitor(s) goals**

When visiting the Coca Women Wellness website, I want to: 

1. Be introduced to new ways of developing my wellbeing and mindfulness practices.

2. Engage with visual, auditory, and literary content that develops and positively addresses multiple facets of wellbeing.

3. Gain exposure to ‘other’ and new influencers who provide content on multiple topics relevant to promoting my wellbeing. Such facets include, but are not limited to;

    - Meditation practices
    - Platonic, familial, and romantic relationships/social interaction 
    - Hair and Skin care products/practices 
    - ‘Healthy’ food  

4. See the site present content that reflects topics relevant to my ethnicity and cultural background.

#### **Reoccurring visitor(s) goals**

When visiting the Coca Women Wellness website; I want to:

6. Stay updated on the recent developments of the site through emails and/or newsletters.

7. Engage in the Online and In-person meetups hosted by Coca Women Wellness.

8. Engage with the Coca Women Wellness online community (e.g. via discord and other social media channels).

#### **Site owner goals**

### 2.2 Website value (Scope)

The [‘scope plane’]( https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.) in the 5PUXD Model suggests that designers should consider the core features and functions that are needed in the intended site. 

Such considerations encourage the designer(s) to assess: 

- The value (e.g. products and services) the commissioned site would add to the users’ experience(s). 
- How this value differs from competing counterparts.

#### **2.2.1 Valuableness of the website** 

The Coca Women Wellness website serves several purposes which increases its value: 

1.  The site intends to bolster users’ wellbeing through exposing them to wellbeing influencers and resources primarily sourced from African & Caribbean communities.  

2. Based on some excerpts from the users’ stories – several women had limited knowledge of wellbeing influencers, specifically those of African and/or Caribbean decent. The lack of exposure to (and promotion of) such influencers within media and creative industries has been a prevalent issue that is now being addressed in the current social climate. It has led to the implementation of inclusion and diversity initiatives such as [#YouTubeBlack](https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_za/creators/ytbvoicesfund/). Coca Women Wellness attempts support such initiatives by providing users with a free, contemporary way of accessing and distributing information around wellbeing and mindfulness practices.  

3. Mintel reports have indicated that the growth of digital resources and platforms have encouraged people to engage with more visual content, specifically on digital devices like laptops and smartphones (McGrath, 2020).  Moreover, visual content (e.g. films, art, images etc.) has greater engagement from people aged 16-44. Such findings echo trend reports’ assertions that around 26% of UK adults are likely to engage in traditional reading (e.g. hardcover books) (Ryan, 2020). As such, the key initiatives of CWW are to: 

    - Bolster users’ exposure to digital content and resources that helps develop positive mindfulness practices which will likely promote overall wellbeing. 

    - Expose users to influencers that curate content around wellbeing, with the African & Caribbean diaspora in mind.  
  

#### **2.2.2 Competitors: How does CWW differs competitors?**

To determine the valuableness of the site, it was essential to analyse how the CWW differs from competitor sites. 

Arguably, a lot of wellbeing and mindfulness websites portray a clinical narrative which is often reflected in their content (e.g. aesthetical design) and services (e.g. therapeutic services and treatment). For instance, sites such as [Rethink Mental Illness]( https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/living-with-mental-illness/wellbeing-physical-health/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-mental-health/) offer clinical services such as counselling and priced therapeutic materials (e.g. meditation courses, books). Moreover, a Google search of the phrase ‘black wellbeing’ presented a wide range of articles and resources written in extremely formal tones. 

While these resources are appropriate and invaluable to addressing and supporting matters around wellbeing, CWW has been designed with a more informal tone. Specifically, CWW hosts wellbeing resources in an informal relaxed way, reflecting websites such as: 

- [World Changer Life](https://www.worldchangerlife.com/)
- [Kwanda](https://kwanda.co/) 
- [Black Zen](https://www.blackzen.co/#services-and-more) 
- [Black Women Healing Retreats](https://www.blackwomenhealingretreats.com/about-black-women-healing-retreats.html).  

## 3. Content

In line with the 5PUXD Model’s [‘structure’ and ‘skeleton’ planes]( https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.); the production of the initial wireframes were key to the development of the site’s User Interface (UI).  

This section outlines several elements which have supported the conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website. The content in this section includes wireframes, mood-boards, colour pallets, font selection and logo design.   
  

### 3.1. Wireframes (Structure and Skeleton)

The wireframes below depict the **preliminary structure** for the CWW website. These have been grouped by page and device type. 

![](docs/wireframes/desktopwireframespreview.png)

1.	[Wireframe – HOME]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/home-pages "Wireframes for Home page") 
2.	[Wireframe – ABOUT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/about-pages  "Wireframes for About page")
3.	[Wireframe – RECIPES]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/recipes-pages   "Wireframes for Recipes page")
4.	[Wireframe – PLAYLISTS]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Playlists page")
5.	[Wireframe – CONNECT]( https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/tree/master/docs/wireframes/playlists-pages "Wireframes for Connect page")

- **PLEASE NOTE:** The structure and appearance of the live deployed CWW website differs from the preliminary wireframes. These differences resulted from **responsiveness issues** that arose during the initial design of the CWW website. Further information around this has been documented in the **[testing.md document](/docs/testing/testing.md)** within this repository’s directory.

Although the structure of the live deployed CWW site differs to the preliminary wireframes; the CWW website has greater responsiveness when accessed by different devices (incl. desktop, mobile and tablet screens). 

### 3.2 User Experience Design (UXD) elements (Surface)

Akin to recommendations highlighted in the [‘surface’ plane](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole.) principle of the 5PUXD Model; the visual characteristics of the site were finalised nearing the end of the site’s development. 

The following sections outline key visual elements that have supported the conceptualisation and implementation of designing the CWW website (incl. colour pallet choices, fonts and logo).

#### **3.2.1 [Colour Pallet](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/feli_fierce/cww_website_colourtheme/) Rationale** 



![](docs/colour-theme/cww-website-colourtheme.png)



Keeping cultural characteristics in mind, a combination of yellow and other warm hues was incorporated into the CWW website colour scheme. For instance, yellow was used as the primary colour scheme for the homepage as it often evokes positive emotions. 

Moreover, yellow has strong social-cultural, semantic, and symbolic connotations within several African & Caribbean communities. For instance, many of these cultures have assigned positive connotations to the colour yellow. Arguably, concepts around wealth, femininity and fertility in some African cultures are often depicted by yellow features (e.g. incorporated into garment colour schemes). As an example, when the Yoruba Orisha – Oshun is represented in visual images, she is often shown to be wearing yellow garments (Britannica.com, 2021).  Similarly, within the Caribbean, specifically Rastafarian cultures, the colour yellow has been included in their native attire and artefacts. Yellow in this culture conveys wealth and prosperity (BBC.co.uk, 2009).  

The other colours throughout the site were sourced from the images on the left-hand-side of the website’s pages. Below is a diagram of the colours used, with their respective HEX and RGB values: 



![](docs/colour-theme/colour-pallet-cww.png)




#### **3.2.2 Fonts** 

The fonts used on the CWW site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and were used on the website for the following reasons: 



![](docs/colour-theme/font-cww.PNG)



1. **Oswald**: This is a considerably ‘heavy’ sans-serif font. It was used on the header sections to ensure that the navigation titles remained prominent across the varying header colours.

2. **Open Sans**: Aside from the header, this font was used throughout the site. It was chosen to compliment the ‘feminine’ theme of the site. Arguably, round shapes are often associated with feminine characteristics. As such, the rounded characteristics of this font conveys a softer tone to the overall page compared to the Oswald font. 

#### **3.2.3 Coca Women Wellness Logo** 

The logo for the site was created initially by hand and then illustrated through the following software:

- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe InDesign 



![](assets/images/website-screenshots-and-elements/logowithtext.png)


The colour **#3E0D05** was applied to the logo illustration for two key reasons:

1. To maintain aesthetic continuity across the site’s element (e.g. majority of the site text, social media icons and some header titles). 

2. To reduce the risk of creating a harsh contrast between the background and foreground. For instance, within visual design practices, bright yellow(s), white and black are often used to indicate warning or danger. As this is not the purpose of the CWW website, the use of the colour black was avoided.


## 4. Features

This section provides an overview of the features on the Coca Women Wellness website, and where relevant, the way in which theses feature(s) address the users’ stories aforementioned

### 4.1 Site-wide Features
1. Logo

    - The logo in the top left corner of the page has been applied to establish the site’s identity. 

    - Clicking on the logo on any of the pages on the site will return the user back to the homepage.

2.  Navigation Menu - Full Scale

    - This menu consists of five page titles that directs the users through the pages of the Coca Women Wellness website.

    - When each page title is hovered over with the cursor, the text (e.g. HOME) turns white. 

    - When the title of  a page is clicked on, the text becomes underlined. 

    2.1 Navigation Menu – Hamburger Menu 

    - Additionally, when the site is accessed on a [mobile](https://github.com/SOlaCoder005/coca-women-wellness/blob/master/assets/images/website-screenshots-and-elements/cww-home-mobile.png) (or device with a narrow screen), the navigation menu turns into a hamburger icon, displayed on the left. 

    - Clicking on the hamburger menu allows the menu to expand and collapse in the centre of the device’s screen. 

    - When the title to a page is clicked on, the text becomes underlined. 

    - The menu has been positioned this way on mobile screen to address the user’s priority. For instance, on mobile the main priority of the user is to navigate around the website with ease. 

3. Footer – Social Media Icons

    - Each social media icon links to external social media pages (e.g. YouTube, Discord and Twitter). These open in a new tab.

    - The user would have to sign into their social media accounts and would then be directed to the respective Coca Women Wellness social media account (e.g. Instagram). 

4. Vertical banner image

    - Each vertical banner image on the left-hand of the website has been used to establish the tone of the website. The website is intended to evoke positive emotions.

    - The images are also intended to implicitly suggest to the user that the website hosts and shares content that promotes wellbeing.

5. Scroll button

As mobile screens tend to be smaller and narrower, website pages can lengthen considerably compared to other device types. As such this feature is particularly useful when the website is accessed via mobile. 

    - The scroll button appears in the bottom-right corner of each page. 

    - The button appears after the user has scrolled at least 100px down the screen. When clicked, it takes the user to the top of the page.

    - The feature has been implemented to aid users’ navigation around the website’s pages, thus bolstering positive engagement with the site. 

    - The feature is present across several devices (e.g. desktop screens, mobiles, and tablets).

|Site Owner |10. | Create a functional website where the user can navigate around easily and access content effortlessly. |N/A|

### 4.8 Future Features

The following ideas could be implemented in future development of the site. These proposed features can help increase the site’s usefulness and user engagement. 

Idea 1: Separate the playlists into subpages. 

- Implementation: Each subpage can have additional content (e.g. articles or blogs) focused on the parent topic (e.g. family or food). 

Idea 2: Create a library page that hosts literary resources.

- Implementation: An additional page on the website would be labelled ‘Library’ and the page can provide downloadable documents. The documents would provide specific mindfulness techniques, such as [EFT tapping](https://www.healthline.com/health/eft-tapping) (Legg, 2018).

## 6. Testing

A series of tests have been conducted on the CWW site’s functionality and its source-code. An extensive report of the tests conducted can be found in the **[testing.md document](/docs/testing/testing.md)**. The document discusses several factors that arose throughout the testing process of the site, such as;

1. Responsiveness issues with CWW site’s initial design and structure.

2. Methods undertaken to assess the live CWW site’s structure and responsiveness.

3. Users’ feedback on their experience using the CWW website.

#### **6.1.5 Responsiveness**

The Coca Women Wellness website is responsive on the following device types:

- Mobiles (Android and IOS)
- Tablets
- Desktops and Desktop Monitors

The CWW website functions correctly on the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge 
- Firefox 

Further testing around responsiveness elements of the site can be found in the **[testing.md document](/docs/testing/testing.md)** and **6.3 Unfixed bugs** section.

### 6.2 Fixed bugs

Aside from the testing discussed in the **[testing.md document](/docs/testing/testing.md)**, two additional ‘bugs’ frequently arose throughout the development of the CWW site, until a solution was found. For instance:  

#### **6.2.1 Blurry images on the CWW’s pages**

- **Issue:** 

    While the photos used on the site were sourced from Pexels.com with a high resolution values (dpi), the images were blurry on several web browsers and device screens.  

- **Solution:** 
    
    After conducting further research into image quality within coding, the issue was resolved by using the property **‘object-fix:___;’** within the .css style sheet. 

#### **6.2.2 CWW's images failed to display on one web browser but not the other**

- **Issue:** 
    
    When using an android tablet, the images on CWW did not display on a Google Chrome browser but did on the Microsoft Edge browser. This issue persisted after clearing the cache and cookies data on the Google Chrome browser multiple times. However, during this time, the images were displaying on Google Chrome browsers on android mobile devices (e.g. Oppo Reno Z) and Google Chrome’s desktop application. 

-  **Solution:**
    
    The issue was resolved by manually resizing images’ dimensions (px) and reducing the resolution (dpi) values. This was achieved using Adobe Photoshop. Arguably, this method can cause issues when printing images, however as the images were to be displayed digitally, reducing the resolution of the images did not have a detrimental impact on the images’ aesthetics.  After resizing, the images showed on both browsers on tablet, mobile and desktop devices. 

### 6.3 Unfixed Bugs 

#### **6.3.1 Structural Integrity: Positioning of a label and input element within the form on the ‘CONNECT’ page** 

- Issue:

    An unresolved bug on the CWW site is the positioning of the form’s input boxes on the connect page, when orientated vertically on a tablet screen (640px-768px). For instance:

    - When the form is accessed on a tablet; the ‘handles’ input element (e.g. Pinterest) will not display on same line as its label and icon. 

    - However, the positioning of these elements aligns when the devices are rotated and used horizontally. 


#### **6.3.2 Structural Integrity: Stacking of text sections on the ‘HOME’ and ‘PLAYLISTS’ pages**

- **Issue:** 

    Another unresolved bug on the CWW site is the positioning of the text when displayed on a vertical tablet screen. On a vertical mobile screen, the text elements stack on top of each other in a column. This aligns with how the site is intended to respond to smaller screen sizes. However, when the site is displayed on a tablet screen that is rotated vertically the text elements do not stack on top of each other. Rather, the elements reduce in size proportionally to fit on the screen. 

#### **6.3.3 Website Performance Audit: Mobile Devices**

- **Issue:** 

    Although the CWW site has passed the validator and accessibility tests, when accessed on mobile devices, some pages have been shown to have lower performance ratings, according to the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) development tool audit.
    
    A primary factor contributing to this performance on mobiles is the quantity and size of the images. This result is prevalent after reducing the resolution (dpi) values and size (px) of the images.  
  

## 7. Deployment

Below is an overview on how to deploy a project via GitHub’s GitHub Pages. This method was used to deploy the Coca Women Wellness website:

1. Create a project **repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using a registered GitHub account.

2. Once the repository is created, click on the repository, then the **Settings** tab, this is the last tab in the top right of the repository’s **navigation bar**. 

3. Once on the settings page, navigate to and click on **Pages** (titled as ‘Pages’ as of May 2021) listed in the left-hand menu pane.

4. Under the header - **Source**,  select **master branch**  from the drop-down list. This will change the neighbouring selector box to **/(root)**.

5. Then click **Save**.

6. Wait for a minute and then **refresh** the webpage. 

7. Once refreshing, a green box with the text and clickable link; **'Your site is published at...'**. 

8. Clicking on the website’s hyperlink in the green box will direct to the live deployed website.
